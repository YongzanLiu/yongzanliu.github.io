Here are some open source materials that I think are very useful for those who are interested in computational geomechanics and unconventional reservoir simulation.
 
- Applied Mechanics of Solids by Dr. Allan Bower [http://solidmechanics.org/](http://solidmechanics.org/)
- Open Source Finite Element Software [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/index.html)
- MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox [MRST](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/)
