- I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Harold Vance Department of Petroleum Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/index.html) at Texas A&M University, working with [Dr. Kan Wu](https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/kwu.html) and [Dr. George Moridis](https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/gmoridis.html).
- Before joining TAMU, I received my M.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering from the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) in 2017 under supervision of [Dr. Juliana Leung](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/juliana2) and [Dr. Rick Chalaturnyk](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/rc11)
- My general research interests include computational geomechanics, fractured reservoir simulation, and integrated geomechanics-geophysics-flow modeling
