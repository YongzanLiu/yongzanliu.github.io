- I am currently a research scientist at Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA
- I was a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from September 2021 to June 2022
- I hold a Ph.D. degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University
- Before joining TAMU, I received my M.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alberta in 2017
- My general research interests include computational geomechanics, fractured reservoir simulation, fiber-optic sensing and integrated geomechanics-geophysics-flow modeling
