- I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Energy Geoscience Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
- I hold a Ph.D. degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University
- Before joining TAMU, I received my M.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alberta in 2017
- My general research interests include computational geomechanics, fractured reservoir simulation, fiber-optic sensing and integrated geomechanics-geophysics-flow modeling
